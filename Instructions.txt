Welcome To Acrossmedia I.T. Solutions

This starter kit will serve as the basic foundation that will help across developers in build web apps quickly. 

Why php? Well most of our legacy apps are built with php.


Lets Begin

1.Install XAMPP
2.Place the template(across_template_mark2.7) inside the htdocs folder
3.import the sql file to phpmyadmin it is located inside the template folder



5.Read and study Codeigniter manual (only if your just getting started with codeigniter) 


6.Practice yourself ...do "First Activity" if no project is assigned to you yet


Note: Always have a backup of this starter kit. So that when a new project arrives, you'll have your templates.
